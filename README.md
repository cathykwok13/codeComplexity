codeComplexity
==============

This tool takes a java program, analyzes the code complexity and visualizes the complexity over time. 
Additionally, a list of bugs associated with the different code versions allow the visualization to 
highlight areas fixed with the bugs.

The two metrics measured are:

1. Complexity

    M = E âˆ’ N + P
    
2. DEPENDENCY /COUPLING
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29

Measured as follows:
