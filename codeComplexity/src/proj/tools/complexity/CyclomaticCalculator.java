/**
 * The purpose of this class is to calculate the 
 * code cyclomatic complexity of a method
 * 
 * The complexity M is then defined as
 * 		M = E âˆ’ N + 2P,
 * where
 * 		E = the number of edges of the graph,
 * 		N = the number of nodes of the graph,
 * 		P = the number of connected components (exit nodes). 
 * 
 * It can be shown that the cyclomatic complexity of any structured program with only one entrance point 
 * and one exit point is equal to the number of decision points (i.e., "if" statements or conditional loops) 
 * contained in that program plus one.
